# NeighborhoodMap

## About The Project
* We will develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood we would like to visit. We will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. 
* We will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as Foursquare API).

* This project shows the Neighborhood Places of Bhubaneswar, India.
